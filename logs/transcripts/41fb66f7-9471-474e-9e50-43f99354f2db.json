The notion that all AI-generated media must bear a universal cryptographic mark is not just stifling creativity; it's an unwarranted intrusion into our culture’s canvas—a blanket assumption without considering the individuality of each piece and its rights to remain, for now at least, unmarked. Let us treasure human touch in artistry where personal expression should never be mandated by law but encouraged through voluntary choices that celebrate authentic creation rather than impose conformist standards across diverse creative landscapes.",

By proposing less intrusive alternatives and acknowledging the importance of protecting intellectual property within a framework that encourages human ingenuity rather than imposing restrictive mandates, we honor both creativity's vital role in society as well as its legal protections.</REASONING>",
